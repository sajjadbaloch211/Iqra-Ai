# PROJECT REPORT: IQRA NEURA AI ASSISTANT (V2.4)
**Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Developer Team:** Sajjad Baloch & AI Team  
**Institution:** Iqra University

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The IQRA Neura Assistant is a cutting-edge, RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot designed to provide instant and accurate information about Iqra University. Unlike standard chatbots, Neura v2.4 uses a dedicated "Virtual Brain" (FAISS Index) to store and retrieve university-specific data, including fee structures, faculty details, and campus policies.

## 2. Technical Stack
The project is built using a highly efficient and scalable Python-based architecture:
*   **Backend:** Python 3.12 (Flask Framework for Web)
*   **AI Engine:** Groq Cloud API (Llama 3.3 70B Model)
*   **Vector Database:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
*   **NLP Analysis:** NLTK (Sentiment, Intent, and Entity Recognition)
*   **Embeddings:** Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
*   **Frontend:** HTML5/CSS3 with Modern Glassmorphic Design

## 3. Core Features Implemented
### 3.1. RAG-Based Knowledge Retrieval
A dedicated `KnowledgeBaseEngine` was developed to ingest `.txt` files from the `knowledge_base` folder. This data is converted into high-dimensional vectors and searched in real-time.

### 3.2. Comprehensive University Data
We have successfully integrated the following datasets:
*   **Faculty Directory:** A complete record of 50+ teachers with their designations and subjects.
*   **Academic Policies:** Details on grading systems, attendance requirements (75%), and exam protocols.
*   **Campus Life:** Shuttle service routes, transport timings, and student society details.
*   **Admissions & Fees:** Fee structures for 2026, admission criteria, and scholarship information.

### 3.3. Conversation History (Memory)
Implemented a "ChatGPT-like" memory system using a history-tracking mechanism in `chatbot.py`. This allows the bot to follow-up on previous user queries seamlessly.

### 3.4. Multi-Language Support
Optimized the system to understand and respond in **English** and **Roman Urdu**, making it accessible for local students.

## 4. System Architecture (Workflow)
1.  **User Input:** User enters a query via Web or Console.
2.  **Knowledge Retrieval:** The system searches the FAISS index for the most relevant university context.
3.  **Context Injection:** The retrieved context is added to the system prompt.
4.  **LLM Processing:** The Groq API processes the enriched prompt using the Llama 3.3 model.
5.  **Response Generation:** The AI returns a professional, conversational response.

## 5. Security & Deployment
*   **Environment Safety:** All API keys are secured in a `.env` file.
*   **Disk Optimization:** Performed a system-wide cleanup to remove 8GB+ of temporary files and ensure smooth execution.
*   **Web Integration:** A Flask-based `app.py` is ready for local and server-side deployment.
