# NEURA: The Sentient AI Interface for Iqra University (v2.0)

## 📌 Project Overview
**NEURA** is not just a chatbot; it is a **Holographic, Sentient AI Entity** designed to revolutionize how students interact with university data. Unlike traditional text-based bots, NEURA employs a **"Visual-First"** approach, combining voice interaction, 3D animations, and dynamic visual widgets to create an immersive **"Iron Man / JARVIS"** style experience.

## 🚀 Unique Features & Innovations

### 1. 🧠 Holographic Neural Core (The "Brain")
Instead of a boring chat window, NEURA features a **Living 3D Core**.
- **Reactive States**: The Core changes color and animation logic based on its current activity:
  - 🔵 **Cyan (Idle)**: System monitoring and ready state.
  - 🟢 **Green (Listening)**: Expands when accepting voice commands.
  - 🟠 **Orange (Thinking)**: Spins rapidly while processing queries.
  - 🔴 **Red (Speaking)**: Vibrates while delivering audio responses.

### 2. 🗣️ Full Bi-Directional Voice Interaction
NEURA bridges the gap between human and machine.
- **Listen**: Users can click the Mic button to talk directly to the AI.
- **Speak**: NEURA responds with a futuristic, synthesized voice using the Web Speech API.

### 3. 📊 Holographic HUD Widgets (Visual Intelligence)
**This is the standout feature.** NEURA doesn't just *tell* you the information; it *projects* it via a Holographic Head-Up Display (HUD).
- **Smart Tagging**: The AI backend injects "Action Tags" (e.g., `[WIDGET:FEE]`) into its response.
- **Visual Overlay**: The frontend detects these tags and instantly projects a glowing sidebar with rich data:
  - **💰 Fee Widget**: A detailed breakdown table of tuition costs.
  - **📈 Grading Widget**: Visual progress bars showing GPA calculation (A vs B vs C trends).
  - **🌍 Map Widget**: Campus locations and contact info.
  - **👥 Team Widget**: A tribute to the developers (Sajjad, Shafique, Waheed, Prashant).

### 4. 🤖 Advanced Intelligence & Failsafes
- **Engine**: Powered by **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**, capable of understanding complex queries.
- **Simulation Mode (Self-Healing)**: If the Cloud API is disconnected, NEURA switches to an internal "Simulation Mode," providing pre-cached policy data (Attendance, Fees, etc.) so the demo **never fails**.

## 👥 Use Cases (What it can do)
1.  **"Show me the fee structure"** → Projects the Fee Table Hologram.
2.  **"What is the grading policy?"** → Projects the GPA Scale Visualization.
3.  **"Who created you?"** → Displays the Team Credits Hologram.
4.  **"Give me the attendance policy"** → Recites and displays the 75% rule.
